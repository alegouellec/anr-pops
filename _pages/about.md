## Deciphering the Role of Polyamines in Bacterial Virulence and Chronic Infections 

The **POPS project** aims to unravel the role of **polyamines** in bacterial virulence, particularly in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (Pa) and its interactions with *Staphylococcus aureus* (Sa).  

Recent findings indicate that high polyamine levels correlate with increased Pa virulence and respiratory instability in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. To establish a causal link, the project will use **multi-omics** approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) across four work packages (WPs).  

### Work Packages:  
- **WP1**: Study polyamine synthesis and Pa virulence.  
- **WP2**: Assess Pa-Sa interactions.  
- **WP3**: Use metabolomics networks to model polyamine-driven interactions.  
- **WP4**: Analyze the evolutionary distribution of polyamine biosynthetic pathways.  

Polyamines play essential but complex roles in bacterial physiology, affecting **growth, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence**. Given *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus*’s **critical threat status by the WHO** and their impact on **CF and COPD patients**, understanding polyamine regulation could provide new **therapeutic targets** against **chronic infections and antibiotic resistance**.
