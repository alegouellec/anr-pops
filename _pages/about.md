Deciphering the Role of Polyamines in Bacterial Virulence and Chronic Infections – The POPS Project
======
The POPS project aims to unravel the role of polyamines in bacterial virulence, particularly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and its interactions with Staphylococcus aureus (Sa). Recent findings indicate that high polyamine levels correlate with increased Pa virulence and respiratory instability in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. To establish a causal link, the project will use omics approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) across four work packages (WPs). WP1 will study polyamine synthesis and Pa virulence, WP2 will assess Pa-Sa interactions, WP3 will use metabolomics networks to model polyamine-driven interactions, and WP4 will analyze the evolutionary distribution of polyamine biosynthetic pathways. Polyamines play essential but complex roles in bacterial physiology, affecting growth, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence. Given Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus’s critical threat status by the WHO and their impact on CF and COPD patients, understanding polyamine regulation could provide new therapeutic targets against chronic infections and antibiotic resistance.
