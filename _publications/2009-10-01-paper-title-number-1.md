title: "Metabotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Correlate with Antibiotic Resistance, Virulence and Clinical Outcome in Cystic Fibrosis Chronic Infections"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper explores the metabolic adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a) in chronic infections of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by using untargeted LC/HRMS-based metabolomics to analyze sequential bacterial isolates. The study demonstrates a correlation between high polyamine levels, increased P.a virulence, and respiratory function instability'
